=head1 Name

PGXN::Manager::Locale - Localization for PGXN::Manager

=head1 Synopsis

  use PGXN::Manager::Locale;
  my $mt = PGXN::Manager::Locale->accept($env->{HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE});

=head1 Description

This class provides localization support for PGXN::Manager. Each locale must
create a subclass named for the locale and put its translations in the
C<%Lexicon> hash. It is further designed to support easy creation of
a handle from an HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE header.

=head1 Interface

The interface inherits from L<Locale::Maketext> and adds the following
method.

=head2 Constructor Methods

=head3 C<accept>

  my $mt = PGXN::Manager::Locale->accept($env->{HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE});

Returns a PGXN::Manager::Locale handle appropriate for the specified
argument, which must take the form of the HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE string
typically created in web server environments and specified in L<RFC
3282|http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3282>. The parsing of this header is
handled by L<I18N::LangTags::Detect>.

=head2 Instance Methods

=head3 C<list>

  # "Missing these keys: foo, bar, and baz"
  say $mt->maketext(
      'Missing these keys: [list,_1])'
      [qw(foo bar baz)],
  );

Formats a list of items. The list of items to be formatted should be passed as
an array reference. If there is only one item, it will be returned. If there
are two, they will be joined with " and ". If there are more, there will be a
comma-separated list with the final item joined on ", and ".

Note that locales can control the localization of the comma and "and" via the
C<listcomma> and C<listand> entries in their C<%Lexicon>s.

=head3 C<qlist>

  # "Missing these keys: “foo”, “bar”, and “baz”
  say $mt->maketext(
      'Missing these keys: [qlist,_1])'
      [qw(foo bar baz)],
  );

Like C<list()> but quotes each item in the list. Locales can specify the
quotation characters to be used via the C<openquote> and C<shutquote> entries
in their C<%Lexicon>s.
