Description
===========

This document describes version 1.0.0 of the PGXN distribution metadata
specification, also known as the "PGXN Meta Spec." It is formatted using the
[Github Flavored Markdown] variant of [Markdown], and the canonical copy may
always be found at [master.pgxn.org/meta/spec.txt]. A generated HTML-formatted
copy found at [pgxn.org/spec/] may also be considered canonical.

This document is stable. Any revisions to this specification for typo
corrections and prose clarifications may be issued as "PGXN Meta Spec
1.0.*x*". These revisions will never change semantics or add or remove
specified behavior.

Distribution metadata describe important properties of PGXN distributions.
Distribution building tools should create a metadata file in accordance
with this specification and include it with the distribution for use by
automated tools that index, examine, package, or install PGXN distributions.

Terminology
===========

distribution
:   The primary object described by the metadata. In the context of this
    document it usually refers to a collection of extensions, source code,
    utilities, tests, and/or documents that are distributed together for other
    developers to use. Examples of distributions are [`semver`], [`pair`], and
    [`pgTAP`].

extension
:   A reusable library of code contained in a single file or within files
    referenced by the [`CREATE EXTENSION` statement]. Extensions usually
    contain one or more PostgreSQL objects --- such as data types, functions,
    and operators --- and are often referred to by the name of a primary
    object that can be mapped to the file name. For example, one might refer
    to `pgTAP` instead of `sql/pgtap.sql`.

consumer
:   Code that reads a metadata file, deserializes it into a data structure in
    memory, or interprets a data structure of metadata elements.

producer
:   Code that constructs a metadata data structure, serializes into a byte
    stream and/or writes it to disk.

must, should, may, etc.
:   These terms are interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119].

Data Types
==========

Fields in the [Structure](#Structure) section describe data elements, each of
which has an associated data type as described herein. There are four
primitive types: *Boolean*, *String*, *List*, and *Map*. Other types are
subtypes of primitives and define compound data structures or define
constraints on the values of a data element.

Boolean
-------

A *Boolean* is used to provide a true or false value. It **must** be
represented as a defined (not `null`) value.

String
------

A *String* is data element containing a non-zero length sequence of Unicode
characters.

List
----

A *List* is an ordered collection of zero or more data elements. Elements of a
List may be of mixed types.

Producers **must** represent List elements using a data structure which
unambiguously indicates that multiple values are possible, such as a
JavaScript array.

Consumers expecting a List **must** consider a [String](#String) as equivalent
to a List of length 1.

Map
---

A *Map* is an unordered collection of zero or more data elements ("values"),
indexed by associated [String](#String) elements ("keys"). The Map’s value
elements may be of mixed types.

License String
--------------

A *License String* is a subtype of [String](#String) with a restricted set of
values. Valid values are described in detail in the description of the
[license field](#license).

Term
----

A *Term* is a subtype of [String](#String) that **must** be at least two
characters long contain no slash (`/`), backslash (`\`), control, or space
characters.

Tag
---

A *Tag* is a subtype of [String](#String) that **must** be fewer than 256
characters long contain no slash (`/`), backslash (`\`), control, or space
characters.

URI
---

*URI* is a subtype of [String](#String) containing a Uniform Resource
Identifier or Locator.

Version
-------

A *Version* is a subtype of [String](#String) containing a value that
describes the version number of extensions or distributions. Restrictions on
format are described in detail in the [Version Format](#Version.Format)
section.

Version Range
-------------

The *Version Range* type is a subtype of [String](#String). It describes a
range of Versions that may be present or installed to fulfill prerequisites.
It is specified in detail in the [Version Ranges](#Version.Ranges) section.

Structure
=========

The metadata structure is a data element of type [Map](#Map). This section
describes valid keys within the [Map](#Map).

Any keys not described in this specification document (whether top-level or
within compound data structures described herein) are considered *custom keys*
and **must** begin with an "x" or "X" and be followed by an underscore; i.e.l,
they must match the pattern: `/\Ax_/i`. If a custom key refers to a compound
data structure, subkeys within it do not need an "x_" or "X_" prefix.

Consumers of metadata may ignore any or all custom keys. All other keys not
described herein are invalid and should be ignored by consumers. Producers
must not generate or output invalid keys.

For each key, an example is provided followed by a description. The
description begins with the version of spec in which the key was added or in
which the definition was modified, whether the key is *required* or
*optional*, and the data type of the corresponding data element. These items
are in parentheses, brackets, and braces, respectively.

If a data type is a [Map](#Map) or [Map](#Map) subtype, valid subkeys will be
described as well. All examples are represented as [JSON].

<!-- Nothing deprecated yet.

Some fields are marked *Deprecated*. These are shown for historical context
and must not be produced in or consumed from any metadata structure of version
1 or higher.

### provides ###

Example:

``` json
"provides": {
  "pgtap": {
    "file": "sql/pgtap.sql",
    "docfile": "doc/pgtap.mmd",
    "version": "0.2.4",
    "abstract": "Unit testing assertions for PostgreSQL"
  },
  "schematap": {
    "file": "sql/schematap.sql",
    "docfile": "doc/schematap.mmd",
    "version": "0.2.4",
    "abstract": "Schema testing assertions for PostgreSQL"
  }
}
```

(Spec 1) [required] {[Map](#Map) of [Terms](#Term)}

This describes all extensions provided by this distribution. This information
is used by PGXN to build indexes identifying in which distributions various
extensions can be found.

The keys of `provides` are [Terms](#Term) that name the extensions found
within the distribution. The values are [Maps](#Map) with the following
subkeys:

*   **file**: The value must contain a relative file path from the root of the
    distribution to the file containing the extension. The path **must be**
    specified with unix conventions. Required.

*   **version**: This field contains a [Version](#Version) for the extension.
    All extensions must have versions. Required.

*   **abstract**: A short [String](#String) value describing the extension.
    Optional.

*   **docfile**: The value must contain a relative file path from the root of
    the distribution to the file containing documentation for the extension.
    The path **must be** specified with unix conventions. Optional.

### meta-spec ###

Example:

``` json
"meta-spec": {
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "url": "https://pgxn.org/meta/spec.txt"
}
```

(Spec 1) [required] {[Map](#Map)}

This field indicates the [Version](#Version) of the PGXN Meta Spec that should
be used to interpret the metadata. Consumers must check this key as soon as
possible and abort further metadata processing if the meta-spec
[Version](#Version) is not supported by the consumer.

The following keys are valid, but only `version` is required.

*   **version**: This subkey gives the integer [Version](#Version) of the PGXN
    Meta Spec against which the document was generated.

*   **url**: This is a [URI](#URI) of the metadata specification document
    corresponding to the given version. This is strictly for human-consumption
    and should not impact the interpretation of the document.

### name ###

Example:

``` json
"name": "pgTAP"
```

(Spec 1) [required] {[Term](#Term)}

This field is the name of the distribution. This is usually the same as the
name of the "main extension" in the distribution, but may be completely
unrelated to the extensions within the distribution. This value will be used
in the distribution file name on PGXN.

### version ###

Example:

``` json
"version": "1.3.6"
```

(Spec 1) [required] {[Version](#Version)}

This field gives the version of the distribution to which the metadata
structure refers. Its value must be a [Version](#Version).

Optional Fields
---------------

### description ###

Example:

``` json
"description": "pgTAP is a suite of database functions that make it easy to write TAP-emitting unit tests in psql scripts or xUnit-style test functions."
```

(Spec 1) [optional] {[String](#String)}

A longer, more complete description of the purpose or intended use of the
distribution than the one provided by the `abstract` key.

### generated_by ###

Example:

``` json
"generated_by": "Module::Build::PGXN version 0.42"
```

(Spec 1) [optional] {[String](#String)}

This field indicates the tool that was used to create this metadata. There are
no defined semantics for this field, but it is traditional to use a string in
the form "Software package version 1.23" or the maintainer’s name, if the file
was generated by hand.

### tags ###

Example:

``` json
"tags": [ "testing", "unit testing", "tap" ]
```

(Spec 1) [optional] {[List](#List) of [Tags](#Tag)}

A [List](#List) of keywords that describe this distribution.

### no_index ###

Example:

``` json
"no_index": {
  "file":      [ "src/file.sql" ],
  "directory": [ "src/private" ],
}
```

(Spec 1) [optional] {[Map](#Map)}

This [Map](#Map) describes any files or directories that are private to the
packaging or implementation of the distribution and should be ignored by
indexing or search tools.

Valid subkeys are as follows:

*   **file**: A [List](#List) of relative paths to files. Paths **must be**
    specified with unix conventions.

*   **directory**: A [List](#List) of relative paths to directories. Paths
    **must be** specified with unix conventions.

### prereqs ###

Example:

``` json
"prereqs": {
  "runtime": {
    "requires": {
      "PostgreSQL": "8.0.0",
      "PostGIS": "1.5.0"
    },
    "recommends": {
      "PostgreSQL": "8.4.0"
    },
    "suggests": {
      "sha1": 0
    }
  },
  "build": {
    "requires": {
      "prefix": 0
    }
  },
  "test": {
    "recommends": {
      "pgTAP": 0
    }
  }
}
```

(Spec 1) [optional] {[Map](#Map)}

This is a [Map](#Map) that describes all the prerequisites of the
distribution. The keys are phases of activity, such as `configure`, `build`,
`test`, or `runtime`. Values are [Maps](#Map) in which the keys name the type
of prerequisite relationship such as `requires`, `recommends`, `suggests`, or
`conflicts`, and the values provide sets of prerequisite relations. The sets
of relations **must** be specified as a [Map](#Map) of extension names to
[Version Ranges](#Version.Ranges).

The full definition for this field is given in the [Prereq Spec](#Prereq.Spec)
section.

### release_status ###

Example:

``` json
"release_status": "stable"
```

(Spec 1) [optional] {[String](#String)}

This field specifies the release status of this distribution. It **must** have
one of the following values:

*   **stable**: Indicates an ordinary, "final" release that should be indexed
    by PGXN.

*   **testing**: Indicates a "beta" release that is substantially complete,
    but has an elevated risk of bugs and requires additional testing. The
    distribution should not be installed over a stable release without an
    explicit request or other confirmation from a user. This release status
    may also be used for "release candidate" versions of a distribution.

*   **unstable**: Indicates an "alpha" release that is under active
    development, but has been released for early feedback or testing and may
    be missing features or may have serious bugs. The distribution should not
    be installed over a stable release without an explicit request or other
    confirmation from a user.

Consumers **may** use this field to determine how to index the distribution
for PGXN or other repositories. If this field is not present, consumers
**may** assume that the distribution status is "stable."

### resources ###

Example:

``` json
"resources": {
  "homepage": "https://pgxn.org/",
  "bugtracker": {
    "web": "https://github.com/theory/pgtap/issues",
    "mailto": "pgxn-bugs@example.com"
  },
  "repository": {
    "url": "git://github.com/theory/pgtap.git",
    "web": "https://github.com/theory/pgtap/",
    "type": "git"
  },
  "x_twitter": "https://twitter.com/pgtap/"
}
```

(Spec 1) [optional] {[Map](#Map)}

This field describes resources related to this distribution.

Valid subkeys include:

*   **homepage**: A [URI](#URI) for the official home of this project on the
    web.

*   **bugtracker**: This entry describes the bug tracking system for this distribution. It is
    a [Map](#Map) with the following valid keys:

    *   **web**: a [URI](#uri) pointing to a web front-end for the bug
        tracker
    *   **mailto**: an email address to which bug reports can be sent

*   **repository**: This entry describes the source control repository for this distribution.
    It is a [Map](#Map) with the following valid keys:

    *   **url**: a [URI](#uri) pointing to the repository itself
    *   **web**: a [URI](#uri) pointing to a web front-end for the repository
    *   **type**: a lowercase string indicating the VCS used

    Because a URI like `https://myrepo.example.com/` is ambiguous as to type,
    producers should provide a `type` whenever a `url` key is given. The
    `type` field should be the name of the most common program used to work
    with the repository, e.g. git, svn, cvs, darcs, bzr or hg.

Version Numbers
===============

Version Format
--------------

This section defines the [Version](#Version) type, used by several
fields in the PGXN Meta Spec.

Version numbers must be treated as strings, and adhere to the [Semantic
Versioning 2.0.0 Specification][semver]. Semantic versions take a
dotted-integer format consisting of three positive integers separated by full
stop characters (i.e. "dots", "periods" or "decimal points"). A "pre-release
version" *may* be denoted by appending a dash followed by an arbitrary ASCII
string immediately following the patch version. Please see [the
specification][semver] for all details on the format.

Version Ranges
--------------

Some fields (`prereqs`) indicate the particular version(s) of some other
extension that may be required as a prerequisite. This section details the
[Version Range](#Version.Range) type used to provide this information.

The simplest format for a Version Range is just the version number itself,
e.g. `2.4.0`. This means that **at least** version 2.4.0 must be present. To
indicate that **any** version of a prerequisite is okay, even if the
prerequisite doesn’t define a version at all, use the version `0`.

Alternatively, a version range **may** use the operators `<` (less than), `<=`
(less than or equal), `>` (greater than), `>=` (greater than or equal), `==`
(equal), and `!=` (not equal). For example, the specification `< 2.0.0` means
that any version of the prerequisite less than 2.0.0 is suitable.

For more complicated situations, version specifications **may** be AND-ed
together using commas. The specification `>= 1.2.0, != 1.5.0, < 2.0.0`
indicates a version that must be **at least** 1.2.0, **less than** 2.0.0, and
**not equal to** 1.5.0.

Prerequisites
=============

Prereq Spec
-----------

The `prereqs` key defines the relationship between a distribution and other
extensions. The prereq spec structure is a hierarchical data structure which
divides prerequisites into *Phases* of activity in the installation process
and *Relationships* that indicate how prerequisites should be resolved.

For example, to specify that `pgtap` is required during the `test` phase, this
entry would appear in the distribution metadata:

``` json
"prereqs": {
  "test": {
    "requires": {
      "pgtap": 0
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the `prereqs` key may not be used to specify prerequisites
distributed outside PGXN or the PostgreSQL core and its contrib extensions.

### Phases ###

Requirements for regular use must be listed in the `runtime` phase. Other
requirements should be listed in the earliest stage in which they are required
and consumers must accumulate and satisfy requirements across phases before
executing the activity. For example, `build` requirements must also be
available during the `test` phase.

  before action | requirements that must be met
----------------|---------------------------------
  ./configure   | configure
  make          | configure, runtime, build
  make test     | configure, runtime, build, test

Consumers that install the distribution must ensure that *runtime*
requirements are also installed and may install dependencies from other
phases.

  after action  | requirements that must be met
----------------|---------------------------------
  make install  | runtime

*   **configure**: The configure phase occurs before any dynamic configuration
    has been attempted. Extensions required by the configure phase **must** be
    available for use before the distribution building tool has been executed.

*   **build**: The build phase is when the distribution’s source code is
    compiled (if necessary) and otherwise made ready for installation.

*   **test**: The test phase is when the distribution’s automated test suite
    is run. Any extension needed only for testing and not for subsequent use
    should be listed here.

*   **runtime**: The runtime phase refers not only to when the distribution’s
    contents are installed, but also to its continued use. Any extension that
    is a prerequisite for regular use of this distribution should be indicated
    here.

*   **develop**: The develop phase’s prereqs are extensions needed to work on
    the distribution’s source code as its maintainer does. These tools might
    be needed to build a release tarball, to run maintainer-only tests, or to
    perform other tasks related to developing new versions of the
    distribution.

### Relationships ###

requires
:   These dependencies **must** be installed for proper completion of the
    phase.

recommends
:   Recommended dependencies are *strongly* encouraged and should be satisfied
    except in resource constrained environments.

suggests
:   These dependencies are optional, but are suggested for enhanced operation
    of the described distribution.

conflicts
:   These dependencies cannot be installed when the phase is in operation.
    This is a very rare situation, and the conflicts relationship should be
    used with great caution, or not at all.

Merging and Resolving Prerequisites
-----------------------------------

Whenever metadata consumers merge prerequisites, they should be merged in a
way that preserves the intended semantics of the prerequisite structure.
Generally, this means concatenating the version specifications using commas,
as described in the [Version Ranges](#Version.Ranges) section.

A subtle error that can occur when resolving prerequisites comes from the way
that extensions in prerequisites are indexed to distribution files on PGXN.
When a extension is deleted from a distribution, prerequisites calling for
that extension could indicate that an older distribution should installed,
potentially overwriting files from a newer distribution.

For example, say the PGXN index contained these extension-distribution
mappings:

  Extension | Version |   Distribution
------------|---------|------------------
 pgtap      | 0.25.0  | pgtap-0.25.0.zip
 schematap  | 0.25.0  | pgtap-0.25.0.zip
 functap    | 0.18.1  | pgtap-0.18.1.zip

Note that functap was removed from the pgtap distribution sometime after
0.18.1. Consider the case where pgtap 0.25.0 is installed. If a distribution
specified "functap" as a prerequisite, it could result in
`pgtap-0.18.1.tar.gz` being installed, overwriting any files from
`pgtap-0.25.0.zip`.

Consumers of metadata **should** test whether prerequisites would result in
installed module files being "downgraded" to an older version and **may** warn
users or ignore the prerequisite that would cause such a result.

Serialization
=============

Distribution metadata should be serialized as JSON-encoded data and packaged
with distributions as the file `META.json`.

Notes For Implementors
======================

Comparing Version Numbers
-------------------------

Following the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 Spec][semver], version numbers
**must** be strictly compared by splitting the [Version](#Version) string on
full stop characters (i.e. "dots", "periods" or "decimal points") and
comparing each of the three parts as integers. If a dash and prerelease ASCII
string has been appended to the third number, it will be extracted and
compared in ASCII-betical order, and in any event will be considered to be
