Revision history for Perl extension PGXN::Manager

0.31.2
       - Combined the pgxn_consumer PID number and file location into one
         output.
       - Configured handlers for INT, TERM, and QUIT signals to log flagging
         for shutdown in the next loop.
       - Fixed invalid license example in the META spec.
       - Added a logger to the Consumer and the Mastodon and Twitter handlers,
         so that they now log debug and info messages about what's being sent.
       - Moved PID file cleanup from the `DEMOLISH` method to the `run` method,
         where it should always execute. This will hopefully fix the issue
         where the consumer mysteriously ceases running and doesn't remove its
         PID file, so never restarts.

0.31.1   2023-10-07T21:40:53Z
       - Restored the writing of the pgxn_consumer PID file, accidentally
         removed in v0.31.0. Added tests to ensure continues to be passed
         properly.

0.31.0   2023-10-07T19:02:24Z
       - Added the application names (pgxn_manager and pgxn_consumer) to the
         Postgres connections.
       - Updated pgxn_consumer to delete the PID file on exit.
       - Updated tag stats to lowercase the tag name, both for consistency
         across updates for this case-insensitive value, as well as for test
         consistency.
       - Fixed test failures on Postgres 16 by replacing PL/Perl-based mocks
         with pure SQL.

0.30.1   2023-02-18T23:15:06Z
       - Added the --log-file option to `pgxn_consumer`.

0.30.0   2023-02-12T00:33:38Z
       - Upgraded jQuery to v3.6.0 and the jquery.validate plugin to 1.19.3.
       - Switched to serve jQuery and jquery.validate locally rather than
         from CDNs. This eliminates a vector for data collection by the
         CDNs.
       - Fixed an error when a the forgotten password form is submitted
         with an invalid label value.
       - Replaced the Twitter posting hack with an extensible, event-oriented
         system based on PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY queues, and a new client,
         `pgxn_consumer` to process events and post them to Twitter and
         Mastodon. Requires a configuration change to enable event handlers.
       - Fixed character encoding in emails.

0.22.1   2022-01-16T20:32:34Z
       - Re-implemented the basic auth middleware to prevent passwords
         from appearing in stack traces.
       - Enabled fixup mode for the database connection, so the service
         can auto-recover from database downtimes.
       - Switched from command-line binaries to pure Perl modules for
         extracting archives. Not sure why it preferred binaries up to now,
         but preferring Pure Perl eliminates a lot of IO::Select warnings that
         were really messing with things.
       - Changed some internal error propagation to use blessed arrays
         rather than plain arrays, to prevent confusing any doe that might
         try to call isa() on them (as was happening when preferring
         command-line tools for extraction).

0.21.0   2021-07-05T22:30:54Z
       - Updated the password hashing to a much slower and therefor more
         secure algorithm (blowfish with 9 iterations).
       - Refactored the password algorithm selection into a function so
         that it can more easily be changed in the future.
       - Changed the minimum password length from 4 to 8 characters.
       - Added clear_password() SQL function as a tool for admins to
         set a user password to a random string and create a reset token.
       - Added the `reset_password` command to `pgxn_maint` for admins to use
         to clear one or more user passwords and send emails to those users
         with links to create new passwords.

0.20.2   2021-06-01T01:48:32Z
       - Switched to a more appropriate README icon in the distribution view,
         and changed the background color for a bit more contrast.
       - Simplified Request->uri_for and fixed the URI included in account
         request emails.
       - Removed unused method from PGXN::Manager::Distribution.
       - Fixed an issue processing uploaded files with no directory prefix.
         Thanks to Damien Clochard for the test case.

0.20.1   2021-05-18T01:56:15Z
       - Removed the `Capfile` and `eg` directory from the source (and
         distribution). Examples for managing PGXN can now be found in the
         pgxn/pgxn-ops repository on GitHub.
       - Replaced all icons with SVG icons from the icons8/flat-color-icons
         project.
       - Updated the favicons for best support on modern browsers, including
         SVG and ICO variants, as well as special cases for iOS and Android
         devices.
       - Added titles to new account moderation buttons.
       - Improved the layout of the new account request userinfo popover so
         that it is in front of everything else and does not overlap with the
         side nav.

0.20.0   2021-05-12T02:15:41Z
       - Explicitly loading Email::Address in PGXN::Manager::Controller
         to avoid an issue where it's not loaded at all.
       - Return a 404 instead of an error on an invalid semantic version
         when requesting a distribution and version (issue #66).
       - Require SemVer v0.10.0 and pg-semver 0.3.10. These releases properly
         support the semver 2.0.0 spec (aside from version parts larger than 32
         bits).
       - Updated all URLs with HTTPS variants to use HTTPS.
       - Regenerated the HOWTO HTML using MultiMarkdown, so as to get heading
         IDs for direct linking and with a language class for the code examples.
       - Distribution versions are now allowed to be less than than previous
         release versions if they update existing major or minor versions. So if
         you have versions 2.0.0, 2.2.1, and 2.4.2, you can release 2.0.1,
         2.2.2, 2.4.3, 2.5.0, or 3.0.0, but not 2.0.0-r1, 2.2.0, or 2.3.0. This
         should allow for the release of updates to older versions without
         otherwise creating new major or minor versions that were not previously
         released. Thanks to Geoff Montee for the report! (#52).
       - Extension versions are no longer checked to ensure they're greater than
         or equal to previous versions. It's simply not feasible to check for
         appropriate extension versions while allowing the release of lower
         distribution versions as described in the last point without
         introducing an extremely convoluted set of rules we're likely to get
         wrong, and likely annoy at times even if they're right. Better to check
         for sensible distribution versions and let authors be responsible for
         proper extension version hygiene.
       - Fixed the email sent to the PGXN admins on error to redact
         `HTTP_AUTHORIZATION` header from the environment dump.
       - Fix the quoting for the reason for a new user request in the email sent
         to admins.
       - Fixed the request object to read X_ variables from the Plack environment
         with a leading HTTP_. In other words, read HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR not
         X_FORWARDED_FOR. This seems to be how X_ variables are loaded by Plack.
       - Worked around a situation where Plack gives an uploaded file a
         meaningless temporary name that Archive::Extract cannot detect the
         archive type for. Requires the Archive::Extract 0.88. Thanks to Sandro
         Santilli ror the report and Philippe Beaudoin for providing a file with
         which replicate the issue (#61).
       - Eliminated the /pub app and moved the /auth app to /. The entire site
         is now served by the / app, so that it can be fully encrypted. Basic
         auth is enabled for those parts of the site that require
         authentication, but the rest is publicly available, including the home
         page, about, howto, etc. The /pub and /auth apps now simply redirect to
         the / app, in case they're still used, although the reverse proxy
         configuration should be updated to do the same, to avoid calling the
         /pub and /auth apps at all, only /.
       - Updated the format of version check errors to show the distribution
         releases the conflicts are found in.
       - Added the /login path and made it the URL for the "Log In" link on
         unauthenticated pages. It requires auth and simply redirects to
         /distributions for now.
       - Dropped support for running PGXN Manager on PostgresSQL 11 or lower.
       - Removed the Pod tests from the release.
       - Fixed a server error when the account registration form is submitted
         with no nickname.

0.16.0  2015-08-31T18:25:24Z
       - Updated the `Makefile` example in the HOWTO to extract the extension
         version from the `META.json` file, rather than the distribution
         version.
       - Updated the `Makefile` example in the HOWTO to avoid trying to
         install the extension file twice, which causes an error on
         PostgtreSQL 9.3.2.
       - Twitter posts now sent over SSL.
       - Fixed warnings on Perl 5.20.
       - Fixed encoding issues with Perl 5.20 and DBD::Pg 3.0.
       - Fixed pgxn_maint so that reindexing failures are reported on the
         command-line and the exit value set to the number of failures.
         Previously it would fail silently.
       - Added the ability to pass the path to a zip archive to `pgxn_maint
         index`. Previously, you had to pass a distribution name and release
         version (and you still can), but that required that one manually
         place the archive where the existing one is, first. This is cleaner,
         as now `pgxn_maint` will process the file from wherever you have it
         and put it where it belongs.
       - Distribution versions are now forced to be greater than in previous
         releases.
       - Extension versions are now required to be greater than or equal to
         versions in previous releases. When re-indexing, they are also
         required to be less than or equal to versions in subsequent releases.

0.15.0  2013-06-19T06:18:45Z
       - Silenced Net::Twitter::Lite warnings by disabling the legacy lists
         API (which we don't use anyway).
       - Updated upload tweeting to use the Twitter v1.1 API, as the v1 API is
         no more.
       - Fixed test failures due to changes in behavior in
         Email::Sender::Simple v0.120000.
       - Requiring SemVer v0.4.0 and pg-semver 0.3.0. These releases support a
         dash before the prerelease version, as required by the final semver
         1.0.0 spec.
       - Fixed a test failure due to the recently introduced restriction where
         different users cannot access the same `%_SHARED` hash in PL/Perl
         functions. Fixed by switching to a temporary table.
       - Removed superfluous commas from a JSON exmple in the PGXN spec
         document. Thanks to Jörg Beyer for the spot!
       - Eliminated smartmatch deprecation warnings on Perl 5.18.0.
       - Fixed test failures on Perl 5.18 due to hash randomization.
       - The build system now tries to always run the tests as the database
         super user. This allows mocked functions in the tests to work
         properly.
       - Updated the HOWTO to properly order things in the `Makefile` and to
         include a `dist` target.
       - Added `remote_host()` and `address()` to PGXN::API::Request to return
         the forwarded host name and address, if present. This should allow
         the proper host information to be included in the registration admin
         email (issue #38).
       - Tweaked the hint for the nickname field in the registration form to
         indicate that it will be the user's PGXN user name.

0.14.1  2012-01-11T18:29:26Z
      - Greatly improved the `check_mirrors` utility, making it work with the
        `mirrors` file, rather than a special, undocumented "timestamp" file.

0.14.0  2012-01-10T04:10:22Z
      - Changed the `utc_date()` function from IMMUTABLE to STABLE, because
        converting between time zones is not immutable, alas.
      - Removed use of `catch` blocks with DBIx::Connector, switching to
        Try::Tiny. This is because DBIx::Connector deprecated its support of
        `catch` blocks in v0.46.
      - Updated for PostgreSQL 9.1 `CREATE EXTENSION` support.
      - Added `Capfile` for capistrano deployment.
      - Added `eg/debian_init`, an example init script for Debian that runs
        PGXN::Manager on Starman.
      - Now require PGXN::Meta::Validator v0.14.0, which has much nicer error
        messages.
      - Fixed version issues. All classes now have a version and the
        `version_string` class method of PGXN::Manager should be used for
        displaying the version.
      - Commented out the `MODULES` line in the example `Makefile` in the
        How-To, as it turns out that it's not as harmless as I thought for
        extensions with no C code. Reported by Daniele Varrazzo.
      - Added credit to Veerle Pieters for table design and to Miles Ponson
        for icons to the About page.
      - Updated the metadata spec to 1.0.0.
      - Allow Build.PL to execute when Module::Build::DB is not installed.
        This makes it easier to run once to determine what dependencies are
        required, including Module::Build::DB.
      - A request to / no longer returns a redirect to /pub/, bur rather a
        "forbidden" response (403) explaining that you probably wanted /pub/
        or to run PGXN Manager behind a reverse proxy server.
      - Documented reverse proxy configuration with Nginx in the README.

0.13.1  2011-06-01T04:26:20
      - Replaced a leftover `ORDER BY semver USING <` with `ORDER BY semver
        ASC`, as it was causing errors on the "Your Distributions" page and
        hasn't been needed since the `semver` domain was replaced with the
        `semver` C data type.

0.13.0  2011-06-01T03:51:17
      - Added version ranges to the spec. These may be used in the `prereqs`
        field to specify precise version requirements. Stolen directly from
        CPAN::Meta Spec 2.0.
      - The "provides" field is now required by the meta spec.
      - Fixed embarrassing typo on the home page. Thanks to Stefan
        Kaltenbrunner for the spot.
      - The hints for creating user names now specify that only ASCII letters
        are supported. Thanks to Stefan Kaltenbrunner for the gripe.
      - Added a link to the mail list to the contact page. Suggested by Stefan
        Kaltenbrunner.
      - Submitting an empty forgotten form no longer returns a 500 error, but
        a nice 400 error and the form to properly fill in. Reported by Stefan
        Kaltenbrunner.
      - Tag names may no longer contain slashes, backslashes, or control
        characters, and must be 256 characters or less.
      - Extension names may no longer contain slashes, backslashes, control
        characters, or space characters.
      - Eliminated "Wide character in print" warnings.
      - Added the "conflicts" relationship to the meta spec `prereqs` field.
      - Now using PGXN::Meta::Validator to validate the `META.json` file on
        upload and in the database. This will make it easier for users to
        figure out what's wrong with their file when they try to release to
        PGXN, while also enforcing the requirement for the `provides` field.
      - Version numbers are no longer be normalized into semantic versions.
        They now must be valid semantic versions on upload.

0.12.8  2011-05-12T23:57:44
      - Updated the HOWTO to add details for better indexing and support for
        the PostgreSQL 9.1 extension architecture.

0.12.7  2011-05-12T18:11:02
      - Upgraded to jQuery 1.6.
      - Distributions names containing control characters, whitespace
        characters, /, and \ are now disallowed.
      - Backported to Perl 5.10.

0.12.6  2011-05-03T21:06:43
      - Fixed a bug where reindexing a distribution would cause the release
        date to be updated in the generated `META.json` file (Issue #26).
      - User JSON files will no longer output a "uri" key if the value is an
        empty string (Issue #25).
      - Added the `-E` option to `pgxn_maint`, to specify the environment in
        which to run, just like the Plack app. This ensures that the proper
        configuration file is loaded.

0.12.5  2011-04-27T18:52:18
      - Changed the default download file suffix from `.pgz` to `zip`.

0.12.4  2011-04-25T16:59:36
      - The directory prefix in rewritten zip files is now lowercase, just
        like the zip file name.
      - The zip file is now replaced when a distribution is re-indexed. This
        is because re-indexing might have changed it.

0.12.3  2011-04-25T16:35:28
      - Distribution and extension names, as well as version strings, should
        now always be converted to lowercase before writing files to disk.
        This is because all these values (as well as tags and nicknames, which
        were already lowercased in file names) are case-insensitive. So while
        preserving case in JSON files, force lowercase in file names for
        consistency.
      - An attempt to upload a file without actually selecting a file to upload
        no longer causes a 500 error. A 400 error is returned instead,
        presenting the user with the form.

0.12.2  2011-04-22T18:51:42
      - Added another workaround to a MultiMarkdown bug to `doc/spec.txt`,
        this time for MultiMarkdown's inability to properly parse a single-row
        table. Hopefully these workarounds can be removed someday when
        MultiMarkdown 3.0 is ported to Perl.
      - Updated Meta Spec links to their new URL, https://pgxn.org/spec/,
        and GitHub link to their new URL, https://github.com/spec/.
      - The "provides" section of a `META.json` file is now properly
        validated, so a missing version no longer triggers a 500 error, but
        tells the user that the version is missing. Reported by Hitoshi
        Harada.

0.12.1  2011-04-20T05:59:39
      - Fixed JSON writing in PGXN::Manager::Maint so that it properly writes
        out UTF-8 encoded data read from the database.

0.12.0  2011-04-20T05:35:52
      - Requests should now all be returned with an appropriate
        `Content-Length` header.
      - Updated `doc/spec.txt` to use MultiMarkdown definition list syntax and
        curly quotation marks and apostrophes.
      - Updated examples cited in `doc/spec.txt` to be actual PGXN
        distributions.
      - Added the `docfile` key to the `provides` section of the meta spec. It
        can be used to specify a path to documentation for an extension.
        PGXN::Manage does nothing with this key, but PGXN::API uses it.
      - A JSON file is now created for new users as soon as they're approved,
        and is updated whenever the user updates her data via the UI. This
        means that usr JSON files should now always be up-to-date, and will be
        present even for users who have no distributions (yet).
      - Added the `update_users` method to PGXN::Manager::Maint, which
        implicitly also adds the `update-users` task to the `pgxn_maint`
        utility.

0.11.1  2011-04-13T02:25:37
      - Changed the volatility option on the `utc_date()` database function
        from "stable" to "immutable".
      - Added `num_to_list` param to the `all_stats_json()` database function.
      - Changed the volatility of the `all_stats_json()` and
        `get_distribution()` database functions from "volatile" to "stable".
      - Changed the "spec" URL template to "/meta/spec.{format}".

0.11.0  2011-04-11T23:41:16
      - Added JSON-emitting statistics functions:
          * `tag_stats_json()`
          * `user_stats_json()`
          * `extension_stats_json()`
          * `dist_stats_json()`
          * `summary_stats_json()`
      - Added more rows to the output of `add_distribution()`. The new rows
        contain stats JSON, to be saved to the location specified by the new
        "stats" URI template.
      - Added "release_permalink" configuration, used to create the link to a
        newly released distribution in the announcing Tweet.
      - Added `update_distribution()` database function, which is just like
        `add_distribution()` except that it updates an existing distribution.
      - Added `get_distribution()` database function, which returns all the
        JSON metadata as `add_distribution()`, but for an already-existing
        distribution.
      - Added the `reindex()` method to PGXN::Manager::Distribution. It can be
        used to reindex an existing distribution.
      - Added `pgxn_maint` utility, and its implementation,
        PGXN::Manager::Maint. Allows maintenance tasks to be easily executed.
        Supported tasks include:
        * `update-stats`
        * `reindex`
        * `reindex-all`
      - Added the PGXN Meta spec, as well as a URI template for it, "spec".
        The file will be updated in the mirror root any time its modification
        time is older than the copy in `doc/spec.txt`.

0.10.4  2011-03-28T02:01:11
      - Renamed the "dist" URI template to "download".
      - Removed the leading `/by` from the URI templates.
      - Removed the leading `by_` from database functions.

0.10.3  2011-03-17T23:29:34
      - Added the "sha1" key to the JSON objects describing the most recent
        distributions for each release status in the `/by/extension/*.json`
        files. This will allow a client to skip the downloading of the
        distribution metadata file for a simple `install extension foo`
        command.

0.10.2  2011-03-16T23:11:33
      - Changed the default URI templates to use `{dist}/{version}` instead of
        `{dist}-{version}`. This allows versions to be more easily
        distinguished from extension names in URIs. The three changed templates
        are:

            "dist":    "/dist/{dist}/{version}/{dist}-{version}.pgz",
            "readme":  "/dist/{dist}/{version}/README.txt",
            "meta":    "/dist/{dist}/{version}/META.json",

        Note that existing installations should work fine with whatever
        templates they have.

0.10.1  2011-03-15T18:31:23
      - Fixed a bug in the upload code where a failure to recognize an archive
        was not returned to the client. Reported by Alexey Klyukin (Issue #4).
      - Now requiring HTTP::Body 1.08 or higher so that upload file name
        extensions are preserved. This allows Archive::Extract to properly
        detect the type of an extension.

0.10.0  2011-03-10T21:53:17
      - Removed conflicting meaning of the term "owner". It now is used only
        in the context of permissions: who owns or co-owns.a particular
        extension. The user who uploads a distribution is now recorded as the
        "creator" of that extension, and listed in the JSON metadata simply as
        the "user". The term "creator" is not used here because the user who
        created the distribution (that is, uploaded it) should not be confused
        the the person who created the code in the distribution.

        To enact this change in terminology, the these changes have been made
        to the code and its outputs:

        * Renamed the `distributions.owner` column to `distributions.creator`.
        * Renamed the "owner" key in the distribution metadata file to "user".
        * Renamed the "owner" attribute in PGXN::Manager::Distribution to
          "creator".
        * Moved the `/by/owner/` metadata files to `/by/user/`.
        * Renamed the `by_owner_json()` SQL function to `by_user_json()`.
        * Changed the name of the URI template for the user JSON output by
          `add_distribution()` to `by-user`.
      - Renamed the "release_date" in the distribution metadata output file to
        "date", so that it's the named consistently with the key that appears
        in the `by_user_json()`, `by_dist_json()`, and `by_tag_json()` JSON.

0.9.1 2011-03-09T23:59:58
      - Changed "releases" status values in the `by_tag_json()` output from a
        list of versions to a list of objects with a "version" key and a
        "date" key, to match the output from `by_dist_json()` and
        `by_owner_json()`.

0.9.0 2011-03-09T21:35:11
      - Removed extra space from generated extension JSON.
      - Removed `NO_PGXS` stuff from the `Makefile` example in the HOWTO.
        Suggested by Alvaro Herrera.
      - Added the "twitter" key to the owner JSON output.
      - Added the "mirrors" URI template to included configuration files.
        Existing installations will need to update their `/index.json` files
        manually.
      - Changed "releases" status values in the `by_dist_json()` and
        `by_owner_json()` output from a list of versions to a list of objects
        with a "version" key and a "date" key.

0.8.0 2011-02-25T23:56:37
      - Added `abstract` column to `distribution_extensions` and the
        `abstract` key to the `provides` section of the JSON output.

0.7.0 2011-02-25T01:22:32
      - Fixed JSON handling inside the database to properly handle UTF-8
        semantics.
      - Added `release_date` key to the JSON file generated for a
        distribution.

0.6.1 2011-02-11T00:08:46
      - Added `--help` option to `get_twitter_token`.
      - Updated to use native `semver` data type now distributed on PGXN.

0.6.0 2011-01-05T03:24:51
      - Added Twitter notification upon successful upload.
      - Added `bin/get_twitter_token`, a utility to make configuring
        the Twitter OAuth token relatively simple.
      - Consolidated the sending of email into a single method, `send_email`
        in PGXN::Manager.
      - Fixed a bug in our exception-handling code to properly include the
        exception message along with the stack trace in log, UI, and email
        output.

0.5.1 2011-01-04T22:54:12
      - Updated `check_mirrors` for new `mirrors.json` format.
      - Fixed the encoding of `mirrors.json` so that UTF-8 will be properly
        encoded in the file.

0.5.0 2011-01-04T21:47:29
      - Added `doc/howto.md`.
      - Moved `check_mirrors` from the PGXN repository.
      - Tweaked the nav menu a bit:
        * Eliminated the "Admin Menu" header.
        * Added `hr`s between menus.
        * Made the type a little smaller.
        * Fixed borders so menu items don't move between loads.
      - Removed the copyright statement from every page.
      - Audited module usage and made the list in `Build.PL` comprehensive.
      - Updated the DBIx::Connector requirement to 0.42, which has an
        exception-handling fix.
      - Updated Router::Resource requirement to 0.11, which has a header
        fix for the method missing exception.
      - Changed PGXN::Manager::Controller to have a constructor and be used as
        an instance.
     - Added mirror administration:
        * Added the `update_mirror()` PL/pgSQL function.
        * Add, update, and delete mirrors.
        * Only available to administrators.
        * Uses PUT and DELETE HTTP methods for updates and deletes.     
        * Requires Plack::Middleware::MethodOverride to support said
          methods from browsers.
        * Keeps `meta/mirrors.json`in the mirror root up-to-date.

0.4.5 2010-11-01T19:13:51
      - Updated for storage of stack trace by Plack::Middelware::StackTrace in
        Plack 0.9951.
      - Fixed permission issue when an uploaded file is moved rather than
        rewritten.
      - Removed stack trace from error environment in the 500 error emails. It
        was ugly and redundant, considering that it's included as a separate
        item.

0.4.4 2010-10-29T17:59:12
      - Updated `Makefile` example in /howto.
      - Updated meta spec URL in /howto.

0.4.3 2010-10-24T21:32:59
      - Fixed internal server error on /howto page. Turns out that
        Data::Section isn't too fork safe when subclasses are loaded in a
        child thread. So moved the howto body into the normal locale
        lexicon.
      - Move default lexicon strings from PGXN::Manager::Locale::en to
        PGXN::Manager::Locale so that other locales can take advantage of
        them. That is, Locale::fr does not inherit from Locale::en.

0.4.2 2010-10-22T20:50:49
      - Added credits to the About page.

0.4.1 2010-10-22T19:22:50
      - Changed error controller action so that it only sends email if called
        as an `ErrorDocument` middleware subrequest. This is to prevent bogus
        emails if people just hit its URL directly.

0.4.0 2010-10-22T19:21:50
      - Improved internal server error handling. Now errors will be sent to
        the alert email address.

0.3.0 2010-10-21T23:31:46
      - Added salutation to new user email.
      - Fixed a bunch of warnings emitted by the Perl code (found by turning
        on warnings in tests)
      - Added "How To" page and tweaked the "Contact", "About Us", and
        "Upload" pages, including appropriate links to "How To".

0.2.5 2010-10-20T23:06:48
      - Added descriptions of fields to the registration/profile form. Should
        make things less confusing to folks signing up. In response to a gripe
        from Damien Clochard.

0.2.4 2010-10-20T17:21:31
      - Fixed redirection after successful registration and password reset to
        go to the proper place.

0.2.3 2010-10-20T17:12:53
      - Built out the 500 error page, which is a static file, based on other
        error pages.
      - Fixed misspelling in the user registration alert email. Also added
        a link to the moderation UI.
      - Renamed `Request->login_uri` to `auth_uri`, and renamed the
        configuration setting to same.
      - Added `Request->uri_for()` and updated places in the public site
        that link to the auth site to use it.
      - Moved the password reset form (to which a link is set when a new user
        account is accepted or a user fills in the forgotten password form) to
        the auth site, where it belongs. This is the only part of the auth
        site that does not require authentication.

0.2.2 2010-10-20T00:29:41
      - Added Error document support for production.
      - Fixed registration form URL to point to the right place.

0.2.1 2010-10-19T06:07:02
      - Added version, copyright, and license to footer.
      - Fixed display of form legends on Firefox so that they're not floating
        above the fieldset with which they're associated.

0.2.0 2010-10-19T04:19:54
      - Added build and installation instructions to `README.md`.
      - Added missing dependencies on Plack::Middleware::Session and
        Email::Address to `Build.PL`.
      - Added `conf/prod.json`. I think the usage will be pretty typical, and
        it will be nicer for folks just to have a file to edit.
      - Changed Archive::Extract error handling in PGXN::Manager::Distribution
        to always die with our custom error message, rather than try to parse
        the original error message, which can vary depending on the
        implementation of `tar`.
      - Fixed a test failure when looking at the sha1 in `t/distview.t`.
      - Fixed a test failure on Test::More 0.95_01 or higher when comparing a
        string to a string-overloaded Email::Address object. Just turn the
        Email::Address into a string to compare instead.
      - Initialize the mirror root on startup in `bin/pgxn_manager.psgi`.
      - User access time is now updated on authentication. Conveniently, the
        `authenticate_user()` function is called every time the user visits
        the site and is logged in.
      - Now using a subdirectory of the temp directory named
        "pgxn-session-$ENV{PLACK_ENV}" to store the session files. This
        prevents the pollution of /tmp with a lot of junk.
      - Change mounts so that the public site is mounted under /pub/ and the
        auth site is mounted under /auth/. They are now effectively separate
        apps. This allows them to be separately reverse-proxied.
      - Rename `conf/prod.json` to `conf/local.json`. The `README` now says
        to copy this file to `conf/prod.json` and edit the copied file.
      - Added  `conf/proxied.json`. This will serve as an example for setting
        up PGXN::Manager to run behind a reverse proxy server.
      - Recommend Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy. I think it's likely that
        the app will usually be run behind a reverse proxy server.
      - Added the `uri_script_name_key` and `login_uri` configuration keys.
        They have useful defaults but should be tweaked if /pub/ and /auth/
        are behind separate reverse proxy servers.
      - Switched router to Router::Resource. It's more RESTy and also offers
        handling of 404s and 405s.
      - Copyright retroactively assigned exclusively to David E. Wheeler,
        rather than to both PostgreSQL Experts and David.
      - An email is now sent when a new user registers. This is so that admins
        can be quickly alerted to registrations and moderate them ASAP.

0.1.0 2010-10-08T01:51:55Z 
      - Initial version.
